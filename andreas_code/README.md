# sp-society-camera-model-identification
IEEE's Signal Processing Society - Camera Model Identification Kaggle Competition

`python train.py -l 5e-5 -g 2 -cs 299 -s 1 -kf` if you have two GPUs, otherwise `-g 1` and decrease batch size (do not forget to adjust `-l` if decreasing batch size)

**IMPORTANT**: You can use this code for the competition provided you are competing SOLO and not as a part of a team. My motivations here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sp-society-camera-model-identification/discussion/48482
